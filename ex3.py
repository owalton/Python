print "Now I will count the eggs:"

print "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?"		# Asking a true or false question 

print 3 + 2 < 5 - 7

print "Oh, that's why it's False"

print "How about some more."

print "Is it greater?", 5 > -2				# true or false answer to the question
print "Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2	# true or false answer to the question
print "Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2		# true or false answer to the question
